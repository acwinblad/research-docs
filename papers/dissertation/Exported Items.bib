  abstract = {Drawn from the author's introductory course at the University of Orsay, Superconductivity of Metals and Alloys is intended to explain the basic knowledge of superconductivity for both experimentalists and theoreticians. These notes begin with an elementary discussion of magnetic properties of Type I and Type II superconductors. The microscopic theory is then built up in the Bogolubov language of self-consistent fields. This text provides the classic, fundamental basis for any work in the field of superconductivity.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the recent experimental realization of minimal Kitaev chains using quantum dots, we investigate the Majorana zero modes (MZM) in Y-shape Kitaev wires. We solve the associated Kitaev models analytically at the sweet spot (th\,=\,{$\Delta$}) and derive the exact form of MZM wave-functions in this geometry. We observed exotic multi-site MZMs located near the junction center, on the nearby edge sites of each leg. This result is important for potential braiding of Majoranas and the performance of Y-junctions made from arrays of quantum dots. Furthermore, we study the stability of local (single-site) and multi-site MZMs modes in the presence of Coulomb repulsion, using density matrix renormalization group theory. Our local density-of-states calculation shows that these multi-site MZMs are as equally topologically protected as the single-site MZMs when in the presence of Coulomb repulsion or when away from the sweet-spot.},
