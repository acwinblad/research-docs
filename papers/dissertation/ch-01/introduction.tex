In this chapter we will review some key concepts that will be frequently encountered in the remaining chapters.
We will review Maxwell's equations, gauge invariance, minimal coupling, and Peierls phase.
Then we move onto MFs in superconductors, their connection to topological quantum computing, and how one can achieve them in a lab setting.
Finally, we will cover the basics of LLs and their relation to the Chern number.
