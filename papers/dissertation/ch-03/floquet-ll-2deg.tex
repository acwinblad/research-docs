\section{Floquet Landau level-like bands in 2DEG systems}
In this section show a 2DEG system with a non-uniform circularly polarized light becomes an effective 2DEG Hamiltonian with a magnetic field that is composed of the electric field component of light.
We consider the case of Schrodinger charged particles in the presence of a gauge potential as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:H2deg}
  \ham(t) = \dfrac{1}{2m^*} \left( \vec{p} + e \vec{A}(t)\right)
\end{equation}
where $m^*$ is the effective charge mass.
As before, the light is made of two linearly polarized laser lights.
Where the first is normally incident in the $z$-axis with polarization in the $x$-axis.
The second is of oblique incidence in the $xz$-plane, to acquire non-uniformity in the $x$-axis, with polarization in the $y$-axis.
This is to introduce $x$-dependence with the $p_y$ term of the Schrodinger Hamiltonian.
The electric field components are
\begin{align} \label{eq:E2field}
  \vec{E}_{1} &= E \cos{\omega t}\ \hat{x}, \nonumber \\
  \vec{E}_{2} &= -E\cos{(K x)} \sin{\omega t}\ \hat{y}.
\end{align}%
In this case both lights have the same frequency of light, this is a requirement to make the 2DEG Hamiltonian into a Landau level-like Hamiltonian.
This form of the electric field relates to the following gauge potential, via $\vec{E} = -\partial_t \vec{A}$ as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:A2deg}
  \vec{A}(t)= \dfrac{E}{\omega} \left\langle -\sin \omega t, \cos{(Kx)} \cos{\omega t} \right\rangle.
\end{equation}%
Substituting Eq. \eqref{eq:A2deg} into Eq. \eqref{eq:H2deg}, we arrive at

\begin{align}\label{eq:H2time}
  \ham(t) = \dfrac{1}{2m^*} \Bigl[ &p_x^2 + p_y^2 + \dfrac{e^2 E^2}{2\omega^2}(1-\cos{2\omega t}) + \dfrac{e^2 E^2}{2\omega^2}(1+\cos{2\omega t}) \cos^2{(Kx)} \nonumber \\
  &+\dfrac{2eE}{\omega} \left(p_y \cos{(Kx)}\cos{\omega t} -  p_x \sin{\omega t}\right) \Bigr].
\end{align}
Again, due to laser light's time-translation symmetry we can apply the Floquet theory, which includes computing the Fourier time-transform using Eq. \eqref{eq:fourier-time-transform}.
This leaves us with modes $m=0,\pm1,\pm2$.
In the high-frequency expansion we still require $\hbar \omega \gg H_{\pm1,\pm2}$.
After applying the high-frequency approximation to first order in $\hbar \omega$, it leads to the zeroth-mode effective Hamiltonian as

\begin{align}\label{eq:H2eff}
  \ham_{\text{eff}} &= \dfrac{1}{2m^*} \left[ p_x^2 + p_y^2 + \dfrac{e^2 E^2}{\omega^2}\left(1+\cos^2{(Kx)}\right) - \dfrac{2 K e^2 E^2 p_y \sin{(Kx)}}{m^*\omega^3} \right] \nonumber \\
  \ham_{\text{eff}} &= \dfrac{1}{2m^*} \left[ p_x^2 + \left(p_y - \dfrac{K e^2 E^2 \sin{(Kx)}}{m^*\omega^3} \right)^2 + \dfrac{e^2 E^2 \cos^2{(Kx)}}{\omega^2}  - \dfrac{K^2 e^4 E^4 \sin{(Kx)}}{m^{*2}\omega^6} \right]. \nonumber
\end{align}
where we shifted the constant energy out of the effective Hamiltonian and completed the square for the $p_y$ and $x$ terms.
Here we can see the high-frequency expansion terms $H^{F(1)}$ and $H^{F(2)}$, as shown in \ref{app:quantum-floquet-theory}, introduce a periodic potential in the x-direction, this can be cancelled out by applying an external periodic potential of the same strength and wavenumber in the x-direction.
Finally, in the long wavelength, $Kx \ll 1$,

\begin{equation}
  \ham_{\text{eff}}^{\text{2DEG}} &= \dfrac{1}{2m^*} \left[ p_x^2 + \left(p_y - eB^{\text{2DEG}}x \right)^2  \right], \nonumber
\end{equation}
with $B^{\text{2DEG}} = \tfrac{K^2 e E^2 }{m^*\omega^3}$.
Solving for the energy spectrum
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_n^{\text{2DEG}} = \dfrac{\hbar K^2 e^2 E^2}{m^{*2}\omega^3} \left(n+\dfrac{1}{2}\right)
  \label{eq:2DEGenergy}
\end{equation}
which is similar to 2DEG LLs spectrum.

We have shown one can achieve a highly degenerate Landau level-like spectrum and QHE in a 2DEG system with an effective magnetic field proportional to electric field  squared and inverserly proportional to the product of spatial period squared and angular frequency cubed $\propto (E^2/(d^2\omega^3))$.
These factors of the laser lights can be tuned and be enhanced in such nonequilibrium systems.
The effective magnetic field strength obtained for 2DEG is proportional to $ B \propto E^2/d^2\omega^3$.
This allows for additional tunability of an effective magnetic field in nonequilibrium systems.
