  abstract = {A Weyl semimetal is a new state of matter that hosts Weyl fermions as emergent quasiparticles and admits a topological classification that protects Fermi arc surface states on the boundary of a bulk sample. This unusual electronic structure has deep analogies with particle physics and leads to unique topological properties. We report the experimental discovery of a Weyl semimetal, tantalum arsenide (TaAs). Using photoemission spectroscopy, we directly observe Fermi arcs on the surface, as well as the Weyl fermion cones and Weyl nodes in the bulk of TaAs single crystals. We find that Fermi arcs terminate on the Weyl fermion nodes, consistent with their topological character. Our work opens the field for the experimental study of Weyl fermions in physics and materials science.},

  abstract = {Tantalum arsenide is experimentally verified as a Weyl semimetal recently. However, it is difficult to grow large TaAs single crystals due to the decomposition prior to reaching its melting point. Here we report an improved chemical vapor transport method using iodine as an agent to get large-size, high-quality TaAs single crystals up to 1 cm. X-ray diffraction confirmed that they are tetragonal TaAs. Specific heat of TaAs was measured from 2 K to room temperature, and hence the entropy and enthalpy were obtained, which are helpful in designing the optimal growth conditions. The as-grown crystals exhibit polyhedral morphology consisting of \{101\}, \{001\}, \{103\}, and \{112\} facets. The key points in crystal growth include using tantalum in the form of foils instead of powder as the starting material, tilting ampule to enhance convections and controlling the concentration of agent iodine. These measures should be applicable to the growth of other transition metal arsenides and phosphides.},

  abstract = {We investigate novel phases that emerge from the interplay of electron correlations and strong spin-orbit interactions. We focus on describing the topological semimetal, a three-dimensional phase of a magnetic solid, and argue that it may be realized in a class of pyrochlore iridates (such as Y2Ir2O7) based on calculations using the LDA+{$U$} method. This state is a three-dimensional analog of graphene with linearly dispersing excitations and provides a condensed-matter realization of Weyl fermions that obeys a two-component Dirac equation. It also exhibits remarkable topological properties manifested by surface states in the form of Fermi arcs, which are impossible to realize in purely two-dimensional band structures. For intermediate correlation strengths, we find this to be the ground state of the pyrochlore iridates, coexisting with noncollinear magnetic order. A narrow window of magnetic ``axion'' insulator may also be present. An applied magnetic field is found to induce a metallic ground state., This article appears in the following collection:},
