	abstract = {When a periodic perturbation couples strongly to electrons in a solid, replicas of the original electronic levels are predicted to develop at certain energies{\textemdash}the so-called Floquet-Bloch states. Such conditions can be achieved by shining light on a solid, but the effect is challenging to observe. Wang et al. (p. 453) used time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to photoexcite Bi2Se3 and observe its dispersion at various delay times. The replicas were seen at expected energy shifts, along with the gaps predicted to occur at the new energy-level crossings caused by the appearance of the replicas. Because Bi2Se3 is a topological insulator, the breaking of the time-reversal symmetry caused by circularly polarized light resulted in the appearance of an energy gap at the Dirac point, indicating an interesting route toward manipulating electronic states in such materials. The unique electronic properties of the surface electrons in a topological insulator are protected by time-reversal symmetry. Circularly polarized light naturally breaks time-reversal symmetry, which may lead to an exotic surface quantum Hall state. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we show that an intense ultrashort midinfrared pulse with energy below the bulk band gap hybridizes with the surface Dirac fermions of a topological insulator to form Floquet-Bloch bands. These photon-dressed surface bands exhibit polarization-dependent band gaps at avoided crossings. Circularly polarized photons induce an additional gap at the Dirac point, which is a signature of broken time-reversal symmetry on the surface. These observations establish the Floquet-Bloch bands in solids and pave the way for optical manipulation of topological quantum states of matter.},

	abstract = {Shining intense laser light on a material can temporarily alter its properties. The effect usually subsides after a few picoseconds, unless the system is trapped in a metastable state, in which case the transient period may last as long as microseconds. Stojchevska et al. (p. 177) observed that, following exposure to a 35-femtosecond laser pulse, the layered dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2 entered a stable {\textquotedblleft}hidden{\textquotedblright} state not present in the equilibrium phase diagram and stayed there indefinitely. The switch to the hidden state could be reversed by heat or a train of laser pulses. Because the switch alters the sample{\textquoteright}s conducting properties, the phenomenon might also lead to practical applications. Hidden states of matter may be created if a system out of equilibrium follows a trajectory to a state that is inaccessible or does not exist under normal equilibrium conditions. We found such a hidden (H) electronic state in a layered dichalcogenide crystal of 1T-TaS2 (the trigonal phase of tantalum disulfide) reached as a result of a quench caused by a single 35-femtosecond laser pulse. In comparison to other states of the system, the H state exhibits a large drop of electrical resistance, strongly modified single-particle and collective-mode spectra, and a marked change of optical reflectivity. The H state is stable until a laser pulse, electrical current, or thermal erase procedure is applied, causing it to revert to the thermodynamic ground state.},
