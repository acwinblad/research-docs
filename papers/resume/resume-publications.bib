  abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations are widely considered to be the gold standard for studying the propagation of light in turbid media. However, traditional Monte Carlo methods fail to account for diffraction because they treat light as a particle. This results in converging beams focusing to a point instead of a diffraction limited spot, greatly effecting the accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations near the focal plane. Here, we present a technique capable of simulating a focusing beam in accordance to the rules of Gaussian optics, resulting in a diffraction limited focal spot. This technique can be easily implemented into any traditional Monte Carlo simulation allowing existing models to be converted to include accurate focusing geometries with minimal effort. We will present results for a focusing beam in a layered tissue model, demonstrating that for different scenarios the region of highest intensity, thus the greatest heating, can change from the surface to the focus. The ability to simulate accurate focusing geometries will greatly enhance the usefulness of Monte Carlo for countless applications, including studying laser tissue interactions in medical applications and light propagation through turbid media.},

  abstract = {Current proposals for topological quantum computation (TQC) based on Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have mostly been focused on coupled-wire architecture which can be challenging to implement experimentally. To explore alternative building blocks of TQC, in this paper we study the possibility of obtaining robust MZMs at the corners of triangular superconducting islands, which often appear spontaneously in epitaxial growth. We first show that a minimal three-site triangle model of spinless {$p$}-wave superconductor allows MZMs to appear at different pairs of vertices controlled by a staggered vector potential, which may be realized using coupled quantum dots and can already demonstrate braiding. For systems with less fine-tuned parameters, we suggest an alternative structure of a ``hollow'' triangle subject to uniform supercurrents or vector potentials, in which MZMs generally appear when two of the edges are in a different topological phase from the third. We also discuss the feasibility of constructing the triangles using existing candidate MZM systems and of braiding more MZMs in networks of such triangles.},
