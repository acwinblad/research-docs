  abstract = {Majorana fermions (particles that are their own antiparticle) may or may not exist in nature as elementary building blocks, but in condensed matter they can be constructed out of electron and hole excitations. What is needed is a superconductor to hide the charge difference and a topological (Berry) phase to eliminate the energy difference from zero-point motion. A pair of widely separated Majorana fermions, bound to magnetic or electrostatic defects, has non-Abelian exchange statistics. A qubit encoded in this Majorana pair is expected to have an unusually long coherence time. I discuss strategies to detect Majorana fermions in a topological superconductor, as well as possible applications in a quantum computer. The status of the experimental search is reviewed.},

Although certain experimental breakthroughs for observing Majorana fermions have been made recently, their conclusive detection is still challenging due to the lack of proper material properties of the underlined experimental systems. Here we propose a platform for Majorana fermions based on edge states of certain nontopological two-dimensional semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling, such as monolayer group-VI transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Using first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling, we show that zigzag edges of monolayer TMD can host a well isolated single edge band with strong spin-orbit-coupling energy. Combining with proximity induced s-wave superconductivity and in-plane magnetic fields, the zigzag edge supports robust topological Majorana bound states at the edge ends, although the two-dimensional bulk itself is nontopological.},

In the Kitaev ladder, we investigate topological properties of the system in different sectors characterized by the presence or absence of a vortex in each plaquette of the ladder. We show that vortex patterns can yield a rich parameter space for tuning into topologically non-trivial phases. We introduce and employ a new topological invariant for explicitly determining the presence of zero energy Majorana modes at the boundaries of such phases.

As an application of our calculation, we consider a thin half-metal film or wire laterally attached to a superconducting contact.

A toy model proposed by Kitaev shows that such states can arise at the ends of a spinless p-wave superconducting chain1.

Although both processes have been observed in semiconducting nanowires and carbon nanotubes5\textendash 8, crossed-Andreev interaction was neither easily tunable nor strong enough to induce coherent hybridization of dot states. Here we demonstrate the simultaneous presence of all necessary ingredients for an artificial Kitaev chain: two spin-polarized QDs in an InSb nanowire strongly coupled by both elastic co-tunnelling (ECT) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR). We fine-tune this system to a sweet spot where a pair of poor man's Majorana states is predicted to appear. At this sweet spot, the transport characteristics satisfy the theoretical predictions for such a system, including pairwise correlation, zero charge and stability against local perturbations. Although the simple system presented here can be scaled to simulate a full Kitaev chain with an emergent topological order, it can also be used imminently to explore relevant physics related to non-Abelian anyons.},

This quantized conductance can entirely arise from the Majorana-induced crossed Andreev reflection, protected by the energy gap of the superconducting lead. We find that the effect of thermal broadening is significantly suppressed when the dot is on resonance. In the case in which the energy level of the quantum dot is much larger than the superconducting gap, tunneling processes are dominated by Majorana-induced crossed Andreev reflection. Particularly, a novel kind of crossed Andreev reflection equivalent to the splitting of charge quanta 3e occurs after Majorana braiding.},

The critical doping is tied to a topological phase transition of the vortex line, at which it supports gapless excitations along its length. The critical point depends only on the vortex orientation and a suitably defined SU(2) Berry phase of the normal state Fermi surface. By calculating this phase for available band structures we determine that superconducting p-doped Bi2Te3, among others, supports vortex end Majorana modes.

It overcomes many difficulties suffered in heterostructure-based Majorana platforms, including small topological gap, interfacial contamination, lattice imperfections, and etc. Isolated zero-bias peaks have been found in vortex of several iron-based superconductors. So far, studies from both experimental and theoretical aspects strongly indicate the realization of vortex Majorana zero mode, with a potential to be applied to topological quantum computation. By taking Fe(Te,Se) superconductor as an example, here we review original idea and research progress of Majorana zero modes in this new platform. After introducing the identifications of topological band structure and real zero modes in vortex, we summarize the physics behaviors of vortex Majorana zero modes systematically. Firstly, relying on the behavior of the zero mode wave function and evidence of quasiparticle poisoning, we analyze the mechanism of emergence of vortex Majorana zero modes. Secondly, assisted with some well-established theories, we elaborate the measurements on Majorana symmetry and topological nature of vortex Majorana zero modes. After that, we switch from quantum physics to quantum engineering, and analyze the performance of vortex Majorana zero mode under real circumstances, which may potentially benefit the exploration of practical applications in the future. This review follows the physics properties of vortex Majorana zero modes, especially emphasizes the link between phenomena and mechanisms. It provides a chance to bridge the gap between the well-established theories and the newly discovered iron home of Majoranas.},

We describe the conditions for the existence of the two spatially separated MBS, which include breaking of spin degeneracy in the two dots, with the spins polarized in different directions. Therefore, we propose to use a magnetic field configuration where the field directions on the two dots form an angle. By control of this angle the cross Andreev reflection and the tunnel amplitudes can be tuned to be approximately equal, which is a requirement for the formation of the MBS. We show that the fermionic state encoded in the two Majoranas constitutes a parity qubit, which is nonlocal and can only be measured by probing both dots simultaneously. Using a many-particle basis for the MBS, we discuss the role of interactions and show that interactions between electrons on different dots always shift the condition for degeneracy. We also show how the MBS can be probed by transport measurements and discuss how the combination of several such double dot systems allows for entanglement of parity qubits and measurement of their dephasing times.},

The proposed platform relies on the proximity-induced superconductivity in a two-dimensional electron gas placed next to an array of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). A change in the magnetization configuration in the MTJ array creates tunable magnetic textures thereby removing several typical requirements for MBS: strong spin-orbit coupling, applied magnetic field, and confinement by one-dimensional structures which complicates demonstrating non-Abelian statistics through braiding. Recent advances in fabricating two-dimensional epitaxial superconductor/semiconductor heterostructures and designing tunable magnetic textures support the feasibility of this novel platform for MBS.},

By employing a method that combines random-phase approximation, the finite-temperature determinant quantum Monte Carlo approach, and the ground-state constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method, it is shown that such a spin-triplet pairing is mediated by the ferromagnetic fluctuations caused by the flat band at the edge. The spin susceptibility and effective pairing interactions at the edge strongly increase as the on-site Coulomb interaction increases, indicating the importance of electron-electron correlations. It is also found that the doping-dependent ground-state p-wave pairing correlation bears some similarity to the famous superconducting dome in the phase diagram of a high-temperature superconductor, while the spin correlation at the edge is weakened as the system is doped away from half filling.},

As a paradigmatic example, we consider the Kitaev model of a spinless p-wave superconductor in one dimension, emphasizing how this model emerges from more realistic settings based on semiconductor nanowires. We show that the flux periodicity of the Josephson current provides signatures of the topological phase transition and the emergence of Majorana fermions (MF) situated on both sides of the weak link even when fermion parity is not a good quantum number. In large rings, the MF hybridize only across the weak link. In this case, the Josephson current is h/e periodic in the flux threading the loop when fermion parity is a good quantum number but reverts to the more conventional h/2e periodicity in the presence of fermion-parity changing relaxation processes. In mesoscopic rings, the MF also hybridize through their overlap in the interior of the superconducting ring. We find that in the topological superconducting phase, this gives rise to an h/e-periodic contribution even when fermion parity is not conserved and that this contribution exhibits a peak near the topological phase transition. This signature of the topological phase transition is robust to the effects of disorder. As a byproduct, we find that close to the topological phase transition, disorder drives the system deeper into the topological phase. This is in stark contrast to the known behavior far from the phase transition, where disorder tends to suppress the topological phase.},

We study the phase diagram of the system as a function of the Zeeman field and the phase difference between the two superconductors (treated as an externally controlled parameter). Remarkably, at a phase difference of {$\pi$}, the topological phase is obtained for almost any value of the Zeeman field and chemical potential. In a setup where the phase is not controlled externally, we find that the system undergoes a first-order topological phase transition when the Zeeman field is varied. At the transition, the phase difference in the ground state changes abruptly from a value close to zero, at which the system is trivial, to a value close to {$\pi$}, at which the system is topological. The critical current through the junction exhibits a sharp minimum at the critical Zeeman field and is therefore a natural diagnostic of the transition. We point out that in the presence of a symmetry under a mirror reflection followed by time reversal, the system belongs to a higher symmetry class, and the phase diagram as a function of the phase difference and the Zeeman field becomes richer.},

We find that topological insulators have strong advantages in both regards: There are no fundamental barriers to inducing superconductivity, and the induced superconductivity is immune to disorder. In contrast, for Rashba-coupled quantum wires or surface states, the achievable gap from induced superconductivity is limited unless the Rashba coupling is large. Furthermore, for small Rashba coupling the induced superconductivity is strongly susceptible to disorder. These features pose serious difficulties for realizing p+ip superconductors in semiconductor materials due to their weak spin-orbit coupling and suggest the need to seek alternatives.

Here we extend this analysis to the case of an effective p+ip superconductor engineered from a Rashba spin-orbit-coupled surface with induced magnetization and superconductivity, and find a number of additional features. Specifically, we find that finite-size quantization allows Majorana end states even when the chemical potential is outside of the induced Zeeman gap where the bulk material would not be topological. This is relevant to proposals utilizing semiconducting quantum wires; however, we also find that the bulk energy gap is substantially reduced if the induced magnetization is too large. We next consider a slightly different geometry, and show that Majorana end states can be created at the ends of ferromagnetic domains. Finally, we consider the case of meandering edges and find, surprisingly, that the existence of well-defined transverse subbands is not necessary for the formation of robust Majorana end states.},

The strong spin-orbit coupling and two-dimensional nature of these surface states make them ideal platforms for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana fermions. In this paper we further develop a proposal to realize Majorana fermions at the ends of quasi-one-dimensional metallic wires. We show how superconductivity can be induced on the metallic surface states by a combination of proximity effect, disorder, and interactions. Applying a magnetic field along the wire can drive the wire into a topologically nontrivial state with Majorana end states. Unlike the case of a perpendicular field, where the chemical potential must be fine-tuned near the Rashba band crossing, the parallel field allows one to realize Majorana fermions for an arbitrarily large chemical potential. We then show that, despite the presence of a large carrier density from the bulk metal, it is still possible to effectively control the chemical potential of the surface states by gating. The simplest version of our proposal, which involves only an Au(111) film deposited on a conventional superconductor, should be readily realizable.},

  abstract = {Quantum wires subject to the combined action of spin-orbit and Zeeman coupling in the presence of s-wave pairing potentials (superconducting proximity effect in semiconductors or superfluidity in cold atoms) are one of the most promising systems for the developing of topological phases hosting Majorana fermions. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry is essential for the appearance of unpaired Majorana fermions. By implementing a time-dependent spin rotation, we show that the standard magnetostatic model maps into a nonmagnetic one where the breaking of time-reversal symmetry is guaranteed by a periodical change of the spin-orbit coupling axis as a function of time. This suggests the possibility of developing the topological superconducting state of matter driven by external forces in the absence of magnetic fields and magnetic elements. From a practical viewpoint, the scheme avoids the disadvantages of conjugating magnetism and superconductivity, even though the need of a high-frequency driving of spin-orbit coupling may represent a technological challenge. We describe the basic properties of this Floquet system by showing that finite samples host unpaired Majorana fermions at their edges despite the fact that the bulk Floquet quasienergies are gapless and that the Hamiltonian at each instant of time preserves time-reversal symmetry. Remarkably, we identify the mean energy of the Floquet states as a topological indicator. We additionally show that the localized Floquet Majorana fermions are robust under local perturbations. Our results are supported by complementary numerical Floquet simulations.},

Here, we elucidate how phase-controlled Josephson junctions based on quantum wells with [001] growth direction and an arbitrary combination of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling can also host Majorana bound states for a wide range of parameters as long as the magnetic field is oriented appropriately. Hence, Majorana bound states based on Josephson junctions can appear in a wide class of two-dimensional electron gases. We study the effect of spin-orbit coupling, the Zeeman energies, and the superconducting phase difference to create a full topological phase diagram and find the optimal stability region to observe Majorana bound states in narrow junctions. Surprisingly, for equal Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, well localized Majorana bound states can appear only for phase differences {$\phi\neq\pi$} as the topological gap protecting the Majorana bound states vanishes at {$\phi$}={$\pi$}. Our results show that the ratio between Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling or the choice of the in-plane crystallographic axis along which the superconducting phase bias is applied offer additional tunable knobs to test Majorana bound states in these systems. Finally, we discuss signatures of Majorana bound states that could be probed experimentally by tunneling conductance measurements at the edge of the junction.},

However, most of these key signatures were probed only on one of the ends of the 1D system, and firm evidence for an MM requires the simultaneous detection of all the key signatures on both ends. Here we construct short atomic spin chains on a superconductor\textemdash also known as Shiba chains\textemdash up to a chain length of 45\,atoms using tip-assisted atom manipulation in scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments. We observe zero-energy conductance peaks localized at both ends of the chain that simultaneously split off from the Fermi energy in an oscillatory fashion after altering the chain length. By fitting the parameters of a low-energy model to the data, we find that the peaks are consistent with precursors of MMs that evolve into isolated MMs protected by an estimated topological gap of 50\,{$\mu$}eV in chains of at least 35\,nm length, corresponding to 70\,atoms.},

We find that the formation of Majoranas depends strongly on the geometry of the system: for a very elongated wire the finite-size numerical phase diagram reproduces the analytical phase diagram for infinite systems, while if the length and the width are comparable, no Majorana states can form; however, one can show the formation of ``quasi-Majorana'' states that have a local Majorana character but no global Majorana symmetry.},

Here we investigate the effect of strong particle interactions and show that a helical liquid offers a mechanism that protects the very existence of Majorana edge states: whereas moderate interactions close the proximity gap that supports the edge states, in helical liquids the gap reopens due to two-particle processes. However, gapless fermionic excitations occur at spatial proximity to the Majorana states at interfaces and may jeopardize their long-term Majorana coherence.},

  abstract = {We investigate correlation effects in two-dimensional topological insulators (TI). In the first part, we discuss finite size effects for interacting systems of different sizes in a ribbon geometry. For large systems, there are two pairs of well separated massless modes on both edges. For these systems, we analyze the finite size effects using a standard bosonization approach. For small systems, where the edge states are massive Dirac fermions, we use the inhomogeneous dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) combined with iterative perturbation theory as an impurity solver to study interaction effects. We show that the finite size gap in the edge states is renormalized for weak interactions, which is consistent with a Fermi-liquid picture for small size TIs. In the second part, we investigate phase transitions in finite size TIs at zero temperature focusing on the effects of possible interedge umklapp scattering for the edge states within the inhomogeneous DMFT using the numerical renormalization group. We show that correlation effects are effectively stronger near the edge sites because the coordination number is smaller than in the bulk. Therefore the localization of the edge states around the edge sites, which is a fundamental property in TIs, is weakened for strong coupling strengths. However, we find no signs for ``edge Mott insulating states'' and the system stays in the topological insulating state, which is adiabatically connected to the noninteracting state for all interaction strengths smaller than the critical value. Increasing the interaction further, a nearly homogeneous Mott insulating state is stabilized.},

We first present the analytical solutions known for the equilibrium Majorana edge modes for both zigzag and armchair edges of a semi-infinite Kitaev model and chart the parameter regimes in which they appear. We then examine how edge modes can be generated if the Kitaev coupling on the bonds perpendicular to the edge is varied periodically in time as periodic {$\delta$}-function kicks. We derive a general condition for the appearance and disappearance of the Floquet edge modes as a function of the drive frequency for a generic d-dimensional integrable system. We confirm this general condition for the Kitaev model with a finite width by mapping it to a one-dimensional model. Our numerical and analytical study of this problem shows that Floquet Majorana modes can appear on some edges in the kicked system even when the corresponding equilibrium Hamiltonian has no Majorana mode solutions on those edges. We support our analytical studies by numerics for a finite sized system which show that periodic kicks can generate modes at the edges and the corners of the lattice.},

The evolution of the peak under varying magnetic field, temperature, and tunneling barrier is consistent with the tunneling to a nearly pure MBS, separated from nontopological bound states. This observation offers a potential platform for realizing and manipulating MBSs at a relatively high temperature.},

Both computing the Pfaffian and a related problem, computing the canonical form of a skew-symmetric matrix under unitary congruence, can be solved easily once the skew-symmetric matrix has been reduced to skew-symmetric tridiagonal form. We develop efficient numerical methods for computing this tridiagonal form based on Gaussian elimination, using a skew-symmetric, blocked form of the Parlett-Reid algorithm, or based on unitary transformations, using block Householder transformations and Givens rotations, that are applicable to dense and banded matrices, respectively. We also give a complete and fully optimized implementation of these algorithms in Fortran (including a C interface), and also provide Python, Matlab and Mathematica implementations for convenience. Finally, we apply these methods to compute the topological charge of a class D nanowire, and show numerically the equivalence of definitions based on the Hamiltonian and the scattering matrix.},

In this geometry, there is no need for the proximity gap to overcome the bulk insulating gap of the QAHI to create MZMs as in the two-dimensional QAHI/superconductor (QAHI/SC) heterostructures. Therefore, the topological regime with MZMs is greatly enlarged. Furthermore, due to the presence of a single helical channel, the generation of low energy in-gap bound states caused by multiple conducting channels is avoided such that the MZMs can be well separated from other in-gap excitations in energy. This simple but practical approach allows the creation of a large number of MZMs in devices with complicated geometry such as hexons for measurement-based topological quantum computation. We further demonstrate how braiding of MZMs can be performed by controlling the coupling strength between the counter-propagating electron modes.},

Here, we show that the Ising SOC generates equal-spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin polarized in the in-plane directions. Importantly, the spin-triplet Cooper pairs can induce superconducting pairings in a half-metal wire placed on top of the TMD and result in a topological superconductor with Majorana end states. Direct ways to detect equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs and the differences between Ising superconductors and Rashba superconductors are discussed.},

With their non-Abelian exchange statistics and fractionalization of a single electron stored nonlocally as a spatially separated MBS, they are particularly suitable for implementing fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. While realizing MBS has focused on one-dimensional systems, the onset of topological superconductivity requires delicate parameter tuning and geometric constraints pose significant challenges for their control and demonstration of non-Abelian statistics. To overcome these challenges, building on recent experiments in planar Josephson junctions (JJs), we propose a MBS platform of X-shaped JJs. This versatile implementation reveals how external flux control of the superconducting phase difference can generate and manipulate multiple MBS pairs to probe non-Abelian statistics. The underlying topological superconductivity exists over a large parameter space, consistent with materials used in our fabrication of such X junctions, as an important step towards scalable topological quantum computing.},
