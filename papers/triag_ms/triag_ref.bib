  abstract = {We introduce a scheme for preparation, manipulation, and read out of Majorana zero modes in semiconducting wires with mesoscopic superconducting islands. Our approach synthesizes recent advances in materials growth with tools commonly used in quantum-dot experiments, including gate control of tunnel barriers and Coulomb effects, charge sensing, and charge pumping. We outline a sequence of milestones interpolating between zero-mode detection and quantum computing that includes (1) detection of fusion rules for non-Abelian anyons using either proximal charge sensors or pumped current, (2) validation of a prototype topological qubit, and (3) demonstration of non-Abelian statistics by braiding in a branched geometry. The first two milestones require only a single wire with two islands, and additionally enable sensitive measurements of the system’s excitation gap, quasiparticle poisoning rates, residual Majorana zero-mode splittings, and topological-qubit coherence times. These pre-braiding experiments can be adapted to other manipulation and read out schemes as well.},

  abstract = {The 1937 theoretical discovery of Majorana fermions—whose defining property is that they are their own anti-particles—has since impacted diverse problems ranging from neutrino physics and dark matter searches to the fractional quantum Hall effect and superconductivity. Despite this long history the unambiguous observation of Majorana fermions nevertheless remains an outstanding goal. This review paper highlights recent advances in the condensed matter search for Majorana that have led many in the field to believe that this quest may soon bear fruit. We begin by introducing in some detail exotic ‘topological’ one- and two-dimensional superconductors that support Majorana fermions at their boundaries and at vortices. We then turn to one of the key insights that arose during the past few years; namely, that it is possible to ‘engineer’ such exotic superconductors in the laboratory by forming appropriate heterostructures with ordinary s-wave superconductors. Numerous proposals of this type are discussed, based on diverse materials such as topological insulators, conventional semiconductors, ferromagnetic metals and many others. The all-important question of how one experimentally detects Majorana fermions in these setups is then addressed. We focus on three classes of measurements that provide smoking-gun Majorana signatures: tunneling, Josephson effects and interferometry. Finally, we discuss the most remarkable properties of condensed matter Majorana fermions—the non-Abelian exchange statistics that they generate and their associated potential for quantum computation.},

  abstract     = {The synthesis of a quantum computer remains an ongoing challenge in modern physics. Whereas decoherence stymies most approaches, topological quantum computation schemes evade decoherence at the hardware level by storing quantum information non-locally. Here we establish that a key operation—braiding of non-Abelian anyons—can be implemented using one-dimensional semiconducting wires. Such wires can be driven into a topological phase supporting long-sought particles known as Majorana fermions that can encode topological qubits. We show that in wire networks, Majorana fermions can be meaningfully braided by simply adjusting gate voltages, and that they exhibit non-Abelian statistics like vortices in a p+i p superconductor. We propose experimental set-ups that enable probing of the Majorana fusion rules and the efficient exchange of arbitrary numbers of Majorana fermions. This work should open a new direction in topological quantum computation that benefits from physical transparency and experimental feasibility.},

What is needed is a superconductor to hide the charge difference and a topological (Berry) phase to eliminate the energy difference from zero-point motion. A pair of widely separated Majorana fermions, bound to magnetic or electrostatic defects, has non-Abelian exchange statistics. A qubit encoded in this Majorana pair is expected to have an unusually long coherence time.

  abstract  = {Since the mid-80s, new classes of superconductors have been discovered in which the origin of superconductivity cannot be attributed to the electron–ion interactions at the heart of conventional superconductivity. Most of these unconventional superconductors are strongly correlated electron systems, and identifying (or even more difficult, predicting) the precise superconducting state has been, and sometimes remains, an actual challenge. However, in most cases, it has been demonstrated that in these materials the spin state of the Cooper pairs is a singlet state, often associated with a ‘d-wave’ or ‘\$\$s +/-\$\$s+/-’ orbital state. For a few systems, a spin-triplet state is strongly suspected, like in superfluid \$\$\^3\$\$3He; this leads to a much more complex superconducting order parameter. This was long supposed to be the case for the d-electron system Sr\$\$\_2\$\$2RuO\$\$\_4\$\$4, and is very likely realized in some uranium-based (f-electron) ‘heavy fermions’ like UPt\$\$\_3\$\$3(with multiple superconducting phases) or UGe\$\$\_2\$\$2(with coexisting ferromagnetic order). Beyond the interest for these materials, p-wave superconductivity is presently quite fashionable for its topological properties and the prediction that it could host Majorana-like low energy excitations, seen as a route towards robust (topologically protected) qubits. The aim of these notes is to make students and experimentalists more familiar with the d-vector representation used to describe p-wave (spin triplet) superconductivity. The interest of this formalism will be illustrated on some systems where p-wave superconductivity is the prime suspect.},

  abstract = {Majorana fermions, quantum particles with non-Abelian exchange statistics, are not only of fundamental importance, but also building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Although certain experimental breakthroughs for observing Majorana fermions have been made recently, their conclusive detection is still challenging due to the lack of proper material properties of the underlined experimental systems. Here we propose a platform for Majorana fermions based on edge states of certain nontopological two-dimensional semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling, such as monolayer group-VI transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Using first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling, we show that zigzag edges of monolayer TMD can host a well isolated single edge band with strong spin-orbit-coupling energy. Combining with proximity induced s-wave superconductivity and in-plane magnetic fields, the zigzag edge supports robust topological Majorana bound states at the edge ends, although the two-dimensional bulk itself is nontopological.},

We examine the connections between spin phases and topologically non-trivial phases of non-interacting fermionic systems, demonstrating the equivalence between the spontaneous breaking of global Z2 symmetry in spin systems and the existence of isolated Majorana modes. In the Kitaev ladder, we investigate topological properties of the system in different sectors characterized by the presence or absence of a vortex in each plaquette of the ladder. We show that vortex patterns can yield a rich parameter space for tuning into topologically non-trivial phases. We introduce and employ a new topological invariant for explicitly determining the presence of zero energy Majorana modes at the boundaries of such phases. Finally, we discuss dynamic quenching between topologically non-trivial phases in the Kitaev ladder and, in particular, the post-quench dynamics governed by tuning through a quantum critical point.},

Here, we report on the realization of a Nb−InSb nanowire− Nb hybrid quantum device and the observation of a zero-bias conductance peak structure in the device. An InSb nanowire quantum dot is formed in the device between the two Nb contacts. Due to the proximity effect, the InSb nanowire segments covered by the superconductor Nb contacts turn to superconductors with a superconducting energy gap ΔInSb ∼ 0.25 meV. A tunable critical supercurrent is observed in the device in high back gate voltage regions in which the Fermi level in the InSb nanowire is located above the tunneling barriers of the quantum dot and the device is open to conduction. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied to the devices, the critical supercurrent is seen to decrease as the magnetic field increases. However, at sufficiently low back gate voltages, the device shows the quasi-particle Coulomb blockade characteristics and the supercurrent is strongly suppressed even at zero magnetic field. This transport characteristic changes when a perpendicular magnetic field stronger than a critical value, at which the Zeeman energy in the InSb nanowire is Ez ∼ ΔInSb, is applied to the device. In this case, the transport measurements show a conductance peak at the zero bias voltage and the entire InSb nanowire in the device behaves as in a topological superconductor phase. We also show that this zero-bias conductance peak structure can persist over a large range of applied magnetic fields and could be interpreted as a transport signature of Majorana fermions in the InSb nanowire.},

As an application of our calculation, we consider a thin half-metal film or wire laterally attached to a superconducting contact. If the half metal is disorder free, an excitation gap is opened that is proportional to the spin-orbit interaction strength in the superconductor. For electrons with energy below this gap a lateral half-metal–superconductor contact becomes a perfect triplet Andreev reflector. We show that the system supports localized Majorana end states in this limit.},

Practical proposals for its realization2,3 require coupling neighbouring quantum dots (QDs) in a chain through both electron tunnelling and crossed Andreev reflection4. Although both processes have been observed in semiconducting nanowires and carbon nanotubes5–8, crossed-Andreev interaction was neither easily tunable nor strong enough to induce coherent hybridization of dot states. Here we demonstrate the simultaneous presence of all necessary ingredients for an artificial Kitaev chain: two spin-polarized QDs in an InSb nanowire strongly coupled by both elastic co-tunnelling (ECT) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR). We fine-tune this system to a sweet spot where a pair of poor man’s Majorana states is predicted to appear. At this sweet spot, the transport characteristics satisfy the theoretical predictions for such a system, including pairwise correlation, zero charge and stability against local perturbations. Although the simple system presented here can be scaled to simulate a full Kitaev chain with an emergent topological order, it can also be used imminently to explore relevant physics related to non-Abelian anyons.},

We find that the effect of thermal broadening is significantly suppressed when the dot is on resonance. In the case in which the energy level of the quantum dot is much larger than the superconducting gap, tunneling processes are dominated by Majorana-induced crossed Andreev reflection.

Several observations of zero-bias conductance peaks measured by tunnelling spectroscopy above a critical magnetic field have been reported as experimental indications of Majorana zero modes in superconductor–semiconductor nanowires3–8. On the other hand, two-dimensional systems offer the alternative approach of confining Majorana channels within planar Josephson junctions, in which the phase difference φ between the superconducting leads represents an additional tuning knob that is predicted to drive the system into the topological phase at lower magnetic fields than for a system without phase bias9,10. Here we report the observation of phase-dependent zero-bias conductance peaks measured by tunnelling spectroscopy at the end of Josephson junctions realized on a heterostructure consisting of aluminium on indium arsenide. Biasing the junction to φ~≈~π reduces the critical field at which the zero-bias peak appears, with respect to φ~=~0. The phase and magnetic-field dependence of the zero-energy states is consistent with a model of Majorana zero modes in finite-size Josephson junctions. As well as providing experimental evidence of phase-tuned topological superconductivity, our devices are compatible with superconducting quantum electrodynamics architectures11 and are scalable to the complex geometries needed for topological quantum computing9,12,13.},

This is achieved by splitting the system into a chain of quantum dots, which are then tuned to the conditions under which the chain can be viewed as an effective Kitaev model, so that it is in a robust topological phase with well-localized Majorana states in the outermost dots. The tuning algorithm that we develop involves controlling the gate voltages and the superconducting phases. Resonant Andreev spectroscopy allows us to make the tuning adaptive, so that each pair of dots may be tuned independently of the other. The calculated quantized zero bias conductance serves then as a natural proof of the topological nature of the tuned phase.},

In the case of asymmetric QD-lead coupling, such a valley-to-peak transition induced by the Majorana zero mode still exists. Next, we observe in the multi-QD case that at the zero-bias limit, the conductance values are always the same as the double-QD result, independent of the parity of the QD number. We believe that all these results can be helpful for understanding the properties of Majorana bound states.},

We calculate the topological invariant and energy gap of a single stripe, using realistic values for an InAs 2DEG proximitized by an epitaxial Al layer. We show that the topological gap is enhanced when the structure is made asymmetric. This can be achieved either by imposing a phase difference (by driving a supercurrent or using a magnetic-flux loop) over the strip or by replacing one superconductor by a metallic gate. Both strategies also enable control over the MBS splitting, thereby facilitating braiding and readout schemes based on controlled fusion of MBSs. Finally, we outline how a network of Majorana stripes can be designed.},

Here we ask whether vortex Majorana zero modes, previously predicted to occur when s-wave superconductivity is induced on the surface of topological insulators, survive in these doped systems with metallic normal states. Assuming inversion symmetry, we find that they do but only below a critical doping. The critical doping is tied to a topological phase transition of the vortex line, at which it supports gapless excitations along its length. The critical point depends only on the vortex orientation and a suitably defined SU(2) Berry phase of the normal state Fermi surface. By calculating this phase for available band structures we determine that superconducting p-doped Bi2Te3, among others, supports vortex end Majorana modes. Surprisingly, superconductors derived from topologically trivial band structures can support Majorana modes too.},

  abstract     = {The vortex of iron-based superconductors is emerging as a promising platform for Majorana zero mode, owing to a magic integration among intrinsic vortex winding, non-trivial band topology, strong electron-electron correlations, high-Tc superconductivity and the simplification of single material. It overcomes many difficulties suffered in heterostructure-based Majorana platforms, including small topological gap, interfacial contamination, lattice imperfections, and etc. Isolated zero-bias peaks have been found in vortex of several iron-based superconductors. So far, studies from both experimental and theoretical aspects strongly indicate the realization of vortex Majorana zero mode, with a potential to be applied to topological quantum computation. By taking Fe(Te,Se) superconductor as an example, here we review original idea and research progress of Majorana zero modes in this new platform. After introducing the identifications of topological band structure and real zero modes in vortex, we summarize the physics behaviors of vortex Majorana zero modes systematically. Firstly, relying on the behavior of the zero mode wave function and evidence of quasiparticle poisoning, we analyze the mechanism of emergence of vortex Majorana zero modes. Secondly, assisted with some well-established theories, we elaborate the measurements on Majorana symmetry and topological nature of vortex Majorana zero modes. After that, we switch from quantum physics to quantum engineering, and analyze the performance of vortex Majorana zero mode under real circumstances, which may potentially benefit the exploration of practical applications in the future. This review follows the physics properties of vortex Majorana zero modes, especially emphasizes the link between phenomena and mechanisms. It provides a chance to bridge the gap between the well-established theories and the newly discovered iron home of Majoranas.},

  abstract = {We study a double quantum dot connected via a common superconducting lead and show that this system can be tuned to host one Majorana bound state (MBS) on each dot. We call them “poor man's Majorana bound states” since they are not topologically protected, but otherwise share the properties of MBS formed in topological superconductors. We describe the conditions for the existence of the two spatially separated MBS, which include breaking of spin degeneracy in the two dots, with the spins polarized in different directions. Therefore, we propose to use a magnetic field configuration where the field directions on the two dots form an angle. By control of this angle the cross Andreev reflection and the tunnel amplitudes can be tuned to be approximately equal, which is a requirement for the formation of the MBS. We show that the fermionic state encoded in the two Majoranas constitutes a parity qubit, which is nonlocal and can only be measured by probing both dots simultaneously. Using a many-particle basis for the MBS, we discuss the role of interactions and show that interactions between electrons on different dots always shift the condition for degeneracy. We also show how the MBS can be probed by transport measurements and discuss how the combination of several such double dot systems allows for entanglement of parity qubits and measurement of their dephasing times.},

The particle–hole symmetry of Majorana states would normally lead to a vanishing Seebeck coefficient, i.e. a vanishing open-circuit voltage resulting from a temperature gradient. We discuss how coupling to a quantum dot with a gate-controlled energy level breaks particle–hole symmetry in a tunable manner. The resulting gate-dependent Seebeck coefficient provides a new way to evidence the existence of Majorana states, which can be combined with conventional tunnel spectroscopy in the same setup. Furthermore, the thermoelectric properties rely on the ability of the quantum dot–Majorana system to sense the temperature of the bulk superconductor and can be used to extract information about the dissipative decay of Majorana states, which is crucial for quantum information applications.},

We present a theoretical exploration of the possibility of using ultrathin films of superconducting metals as a platform for TSC. Because they necessarily break inversion symmetry when prepared on a substrate and have intrinsic Cooper pairing, they can be TSCs when time-reversal symmetry is broken by an external magnetic field. Using microscopic density functional theory calculations we show that, for ultrathin Pb and β-Sn superconductors, the position of the Fermi level can be tuned to quasi-2D band extrema energies using strain, and that the g factors of states at time-reversal invariant momenta can be extremely large, enhancing the influence of external magnetic fields.},

Their defining property is that an adiabatic braid between two of them results in a non-trivial change of the quantum state of the system. The simplest non-Abelian quasiparticles—the Majorana bound states—can occur in one-dimensional electronic nano-structures proximity-coupled to a bulk superconductor. Here we propose a set-up, based on chains of magnetic adatoms on the surface of a thin-film superconductor, in which the control over an externally applied magnetic field suffices to create and manipulate Majorana bound states. We consider specifically rings of adatoms and show that they allow for the creation, annihilation, adiabatic motion and braiding of pairs of Majorana bound states by varying the magnitude and orientation of the external magnetic field.},

All logical Clifford gates are implemented with zero-time overhead. This is done by introducing a protocol for Pauli product measurements with tetrons and hexons which only requires local 4-Majorana parity measurements. An analogous protocol is used in the fault-tolerant setting, where tetrons and hexons are replaced by Majorana surface code patches, and parity measurements are replaced by lattice surgery, still only requiring local few-Majorana parity measurements. To this end, we discuss twist defects in Majorana fermion surface codes and adapt the technique of twist-based lattice surgery to fermionic codes. Moreover, we propose a family of codes that we refer to as Majorana color codes, which are obtained by concatenating Majorana surface codes with small Majorana fermion codes. Majorana surface and color codes can be used to decrease the space overhead and stabilizer weight compared to their bosonic counterparts.},

  abstract = {In a recent breakthrough experiment [Nature (London) 614, 445 (2023)], signatures of Majorana zero modes have been observed in tunnel spectroscopy for a minimal Kitaev chain constructed from coupled quantum dots. However, as Ising anyons, Majoranas' most fundamental property of non-Abelian statistics is yet to be detected. Moreover, the minimal Kitaev chain is qualitatively different from topological superconductors in that it supports Majoranas only at a sweet spot. Therefore, it is not obvious whether non-Abelian characteristics such as braiding and fusion can be demonstrated in this platform with a reasonable level of robustness. In this work, we theoretically propose a protocol for detecting the Majorana fusion rules in an artificial Kitaev chain consisting of four quantum dots. In contrast with the previous proposals for semiconductor-superconductor hybrid nanowire platforms, here we do not rely on mesoscopic superconducting islands, which are difficult to implement in quantum dot chains. To show the robustness of the fusion protocol, we discuss the effects of three types of realistic imperfections on the fusion outcomes, e.g., diabatic errors, dephasing errors, and calibration errors. We also propose a fermion parity readout scheme using quantum capacitance. Our work will shed light on future experiments on detecting the non-Abelian properties of Majorana modes in a quantum dot chain.},

Our key finding is that multiband occupancy not only lifts the stringent constraint of one-dimensionality but also allows one to have higher carrier density in the nanowire, and as such multisubband nanowires are better suited for observing the Majorana particle. We study the robustness of the topological phase by including the effects of the short- and long-range disorder.

The spin susceptibility and effective pairing interactions at the edge strongly increase as the on-site Coulomb interaction increases, indicating the importance of electron-electron correlations. It is also found that the doping-dependent ground-state p-wave pairing correlation bears some similarity to the famous superconducting dome in the phase diagram of a high-temperature superconductor, while the spin correlation at the edge is weakened as the system is doped away from half filling.},

We introduce fermion-parity-based computation (FPBC): a measurement-based scheme, modeled on Pauli-based computation, that uses efficient classical processing to virtually increase the number of available MZMs and which, given magic state inputs, operates without transformations. FPBC requires all MZM parities to be measurable, but this conflicts with constraints in proposed MZM hardware. We thus introduce a design in which all parities are directly measurable and which is hence well suited for FPBC. While developing FPBC, we identify the “logical braid group” as the fermionic analog of the Clifford group.},

  abstract = {We present measurements and simulations of semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure devices that are consistent with the observation of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes. The devices are fabricated from high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in which quasi-one-dimensional wires are defined by electrostatic gates. These devices enable measurements of local and nonlocal transport properties and have been optimized via extensive simulations to ensure robustness against nonuniformity and disorder. Our main result is that several devices, fabricated according to the design's engineering specifications, have passed the topological gap protocol defined in Pikulin et al. (arXiv:2103.12217). This protocol is a stringent test composed of a sequence of three-terminal local and nonlocal transport measurements performed while varying the magnetic field, semiconductor electron density, and junction transparencies. Passing the protocol indicates a high probability of detection of a topological phase hosting Majorana zero modes as determined by large-scale disorder simulations. Our experimental results are consistent with a quantum phase transition into a topological superconducting phase that extends over several hundred millitesla in magnetic field and several millivolts in gate voltage, corresponding to approximately one hundred microelectronvolts in Zeeman energy and chemical potential in the semiconducting wire. These regions feature a closing and reopening of the bulk gap, with simultaneous zero-bias conductance peaks at both ends of the devices that withstand changes in the junction transparencies. The extracted maximum topological gaps in our devices are 20–60µeV. This demonstration is a prerequisite for experiments involving fusion and braiding of Majorana zero modes.},

  abstract = {Topological quantum computation encodes quantum information nonlocally by nucleating non-Abelian anyons separated by distances Unknown node type: brtsckft, typically spanning the qubit device size. This nonlocality renders topological qubits exponentially immune to dephasing from all sources of classical noise with operator support local on the scale of Unknown node type: brtsckft. We perform detailed analytical and numerical analyses of a time-domain Ramsey-type protocol for noisy Majorana-based qubits that is designed to validate this coveted topological protection in near-term devices such as the so-called “tetron” design. By assessing dependence of dephasing times on tunable parameters, e.g., magnetic field, our proposed protocol can clearly distinguish a bona fide Majorana qubit from one constructed from semilocal Andreev bound states, which can otherwise closely mimic the true topological scenario in local probes. In addition, we analyze leakage of the qubit out of its low-energy manifold due to classical-noise-induced generation of quasiparticle excitations; leakage limits the qubit lifetime when the bulk gap collapses, and hence our protocol further reveals the onset of a topological phase transition. This experiment requires measurement of two nearby Majorana modes for both initialization and readout—achievable, for example, by tunnel coupling to a nearby quantum dot—but no further Majorana manipulations, and thus constitutes an enticing prebraiding experiment. Along the way, we address conceptual subtleties encountered when discussing dephasing and leakage in the context of Majorana qubits.},

Using high-resolution spectroscopic imaging techniques, we show that the onset of superconductivity, which gaps the electronic density of states in the bulk of the Fe chains, is accompanied by the appearance of zero-energy end-states.

  abstract = {Topological quantum computation has emerged as one of the most exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles known as non-Abelian anyons, meaning that they obey non-Abelian braiding statistics. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate operations that are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by braiding quasiparticles and then measuring the multiquasiparticle states. The fault tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the nonlocal encoding of the quasiparticle states, which makes them immune to errors caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most prominently the ν=5∕2 state, although several other prospective candidates have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and thin-film superconductors. In this review article, current research in this field is described, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological quantum computer. Both the mathematical underpinnings of topological quantum computation and the physics of the subject are addressed, using the ν=5∕2 fractional quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

We consider an adiabatic cycle performed on the degenerate ground-state manifold and show that it realizes the braiding of the two modes whereby they accumulate a nontrivial statistical phase π within one cycle. Alongside the PHS-ensured operator algebra, the fractional statistics confirms the Majorana nature of the zero-energy excitations.

  abstract = {We investigate Josephson currents in mesoscopic rings with a weak link which are in or near a topological superconducting phase. As a paradigmatic example, we consider the Kitaev model of a spinless p-wave superconductor in one dimension, emphasizing how this model emerges from more realistic settings based on semiconductor nanowires. We show that the flux periodicity of the Josephson current provides signatures of the topological phase transition and the emergence of Majorana fermions (MF) situated on both sides of the weak link even when fermion parity is not a good quantum number. In large rings, the MF hybridize only across the weak link. In this case, the Josephson current is h/e periodic in the flux threading the loop when fermion parity is a good quantum number but reverts to the more conventional h/2e periodicity in the presence of fermion-parity changing relaxation processes. In mesoscopic rings, the MF also hybridize through their overlap in the interior of the superconducting ring. We find that in the topological superconducting phase, this gives rise to an h/e-periodic contribution even when fermion parity is not conserved and that this contribution exhibits a peak near the topological phase transition. This signature of the topological phase transition is robust to the effects of disorder. As a byproduct, we find that close to the topological phase transition, disorder drives the system deeper into the topological phase. This is in stark contrast to the known behavior far from the phase transition, where disorder tends to suppress the topological phase.},

We show that in the presence of an in-plane Zeeman field, the quasi-one-dimensional region between the two superconductors can support a topological superconducting phase hosting Majorana bound states at its ends. We study the phase diagram of the system as a function of the Zeeman field and the phase difference between the two superconductors (treated as an externally controlled parameter). Remarkably, at a phase difference of π, the topological phase is obtained for almost any value of the Zeeman field and chemical potential. In a setup where the phase is not controlled externally, we find that the system undergoes a first-order topological phase transition when the Zeeman field is varied. At the transition, the phase difference in the ground state changes abruptly from a value close to zero, at which the system is trivial, to a value close to π, at which the system is topological. The critical current through the junction exhibits a sharp minimum at the critical Zeeman field and is therefore a natural diagnostic of the transition. We point out that in the presence of a symmetry under a mirror reflection followed by time reversal, the system belongs to a higher symmetry class, and the phase diagram as a function of the phase difference and the Zeeman field becomes richer.},

Specifically, in each type of material we examine (1) the limitations to inducing superconductivity by proximity to an ordinary s-wave superconductor, and (2) the robustness of the resulting superconductivity against disorder. We find that topological insulators have strong advantages in both regards: There are no fundamental barriers to inducing superconductivity, and the induced superconductivity is immune to disorder. In contrast, for Rashba-coupled quantum wires or surface states, the achievable gap from induced superconductivity is limited unless the Rashba coupling is large. Furthermore, for small Rashba coupling the induced superconductivity is strongly susceptible to disorder. These features pose serious difficulties for realizing p+ip superconductors in semiconductor materials due to their weak spin-orbit coupling and suggest the need to seek alternatives.

Lett. 105, 227003 (2010)] demonstrated, for an ideal spinless p+ip superconductor, that Majorana end states can be realized outside the strict one-dimensional limit, so long as (1) the sample width does not greatly exceed the superconducting coherence length and (2) an odd number of transverse subbands are occupied. Here we extend this analysis to the case of an effective p+ip superconductor engineered from a Rashba spin-orbit-coupled surface with induced magnetization and superconductivity, and find a number of additional features. Specifically, we find that finite-size quantization allows Majorana end states even when the chemical potential is outside of the induced Zeeman gap where the bulk material would not be topological. This is relevant to proposals utilizing semiconducting quantum wires; however, we also find that the bulk energy gap is substantially reduced if the induced magnetization is too large. We next consider a slightly different geometry, and show that Majorana end states can be created at the ends of ferromagnetic domains. Finally, we consider the case of meandering edges and find, surprisingly, that the existence of well-defined transverse subbands is not necessary for the formation of robust Majorana end states.},

  abstract = {The ends of one-dimensional p+ip superconductors have long been predicted to possess localized Majorana fermion modes [A. Kitaev, arXiv:cond-mat/0010440]. We show that Majorana end states are robust beyond the strict 1D single-channel limit, so long as the sample width is not much larger than the superconducting coherence length, and they exist when an odd number of transverse quantization channels are occupied. Consequently, the system undergoes a sequence of topological phase transitions driven by changing the chemical potential. These observations make it feasible to implement quasi-1D p+ip superconductors in metallic thin-film microstructures, which offer 3–4 orders of magnitude larger energy scales than semiconductor-based schemes. Some promising candidate materials are described.},

  abstract = {Heavy metals, such as Au, Ag, and Pb, often have sharp surface states that are split by strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The strong spin-orbit coupling and two-dimensional nature of these surface states make them ideal platforms for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana fermions. In this paper we further develop a proposal to realize Majorana fermions at the ends of quasi-one-dimensional metallic wires. We show how superconductivity can be induced on the metallic surface states by a combination of proximity effect, disorder, and interactions. Applying a magnetic field along the wire can drive the wire into a topologically nontrivial state with Majorana end states. Unlike the case of a perpendicular field, where the chemical potential must be fine-tuned near the Rashba band crossing, the parallel field allows one to realize Majorana fermions for an arbitrarily large chemical potential. We then show that, despite the presence of a large carrier density from the bulk metal, it is still possible to effectively control the chemical potential of the surface states by gating. The simplest version of our proposal, which involves only an Au(111) film deposited on a conventional superconductor, should be readily realizable.},

Recently MFs have been intensively studied in solid state and cold atomic systems. These studies are generally based on superconducting pairing with zero total momentum. On the other hand, finite total momentum Cooper pairings, known as Fulde–Ferrell (FF) Larkin–Ovchinnikov (LO) states, were widely studied in many branches of physics. However, whether FF and LO superconductors can support MFs has not been explored. Here we show that MFs can exist in certain types of gapped FF states, yielding a new quantum matter: topological FF superfluids/superconductors. We demonstrate the existence of such topological FF superfluids and the associated MFs using spin–orbit-coupled degenerate Fermi gases and derive their parameter regions. The implementation of topological FF superconductors in semiconductor/superconductor heterostructures is also discussed.},

  abstract = {We analyze pairing of fermions in two dimensions for fully gapped cases with broken parity (P) and time reversal (T), especially cases in which the gap function is an orbital angular momentum (l) eigenstate, in particular l=−1 (p wave, spinless, or spin triplet) and l=−2 (d wave, spin singlet). For l≠0, these fall into two phases, weak and strong pairing, which may be distinguished topologically. In the cases with conserved spin, we derive explicitly the Hall conductivity for spin as the corresponding topological invariant. For the spinless p-wave case, the weak-pairing phase has a pair wave function that is asympototically the same as that in the Moore-Read (Pfaffian) quantum Hall state, and we argue that its other properties (edge states, quasihole, and toroidal ground states) are also the same, indicating that nonabelian statistics is a generic property of such a paired phase. The strong-pairing phase is an abelian state, and the transition between the two phases involves a bulk Majorana fermion, the mass of which changes sign at the transition. For the d-wave case, we argue that the Haldane-Rezayi state is not the generic behavior of a phase but describes the asymptotics at the critical point between weak and strong pairing, and has gapless fermion excitations in the bulk. In this case the weak-pairing phase is an abelian phase, which has been considered previously. In the p-wave case with an unbroken U(1) symmetry, which can be applied to the double layer quantum Hall problem, the weak-pairing phase has the properties of the 331 state, and with nonzero tunneling there is a transition to the Moore-Read phase. The effects of disorder on noninteracting quasiparticles are considered. The gapped phases survive, but there is an intermediate thermally conducting phase in the spinless p-wave case, in which the quasiparticles are extended.},

  abstract     = {Topological superconductors can support localized Majorana states at their boundaries1–5. These quasi-particle excitations obey non-Abelian statistics that can be used to encode and manipulate quantum information in a topologically protected manner6,7. Although signatures of Majorana bound states have been observed in one-dimensional systems, there is an ongoing effort to find alternative platforms that do not require fine-tuning of parameters and can be easily scaled to large numbers of states8–21. Here we present an experimental approach towards a two-dimensional architecture of Majorana bound states. Using a Josephson junction made of a HgTe quantum well coupled to thin-film aluminium, we are able to tune the transition between a trivial and a topological superconducting state by controlling the phase difference across the junction and applying an in-plane magnetic field22. We determine the topological state of the resulting superconductor by measuring the tunnelling conductance at the edge of the junction. At low magnetic fields, we observe a minimum in the tunnelling spectra near zero bias, consistent with a trivial superconductor. However, as the magnetic field increases, the tunnelling conductance develops a zero-bias peak, which persists over a range of phase differences that expands systematically with increasing magnetic field. Our observations are consistent with theoretical predictions for this system and with full quantum mechanical numerical simulations performed on model systems with similar dimensions and parameters. Our work establishes this system as a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and for creating and manipulating Majorana modes and probing topological superconducting phases in two-dimensional systems.},

  abstract = {Quantum wires subject to the combined action of spin-orbit and Zeeman coupling in the presence of s-wave pairing potentials (superconducting proximity effect in semiconductors or superfluidity in cold atoms) are one of the most promising systems for the developing of topological phases hosting Majorana fermions. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry is essential for the appearance of unpaired Majorana fermions. By implementing a time-dependent spin rotation, we show that the standard magnetostatic model maps into a nonmagnetic one where the breaking of time-reversal symmetry is guaranteed by a periodical change of the spin-orbit coupling axis as a function of time. This suggests the possibility of developing the topological superconducting state of matter driven by external forces in the absence of magnetic fields and magnetic elements. From a practical viewpoint, the scheme avoids the disadvantages of conjugating magnetism and superconductivity, even though the need of a high-frequency driving of spin-orbit coupling may represent a technological challenge. We describe the basic properties of this Floquet system by showing that finite samples host unpaired Majorana fermions at their edges despite the fact that the bulk Floquet quasienergies are gapless and that the Hamiltonian at each instant of time preserves time-reversal symmetry. Remarkably, we identify the mean energy of the Floquet states as a topological indicator. We additionally show that the localized Floquet Majorana fermions are robust under local perturbations. Our results are supported by complementary numerical Floquet simulations.},

Here, we elucidate how phase-controlled Josephson junctions based on quantum wells with [001] growth direction and an arbitrary combination of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling can also host Majorana bound states for a wide range of parameters as long as the magnetic field is oriented appropriately. Hence, Majorana bound states based on Josephson junctions can appear in a wide class of two-dimensional electron gases. We study the effect of spin-orbit coupling, the Zeeman energies, and the superconducting phase difference to create a full topological phase diagram and find the optimal stability region to observe Majorana bound states in narrow junctions. Surprisingly, for equal Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, well localized Majorana bound states can appear only for phase differences ϕ≠π as the topological gap protecting the Majorana bound states vanishes at ϕ=π. Our results show that the ratio between Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling or the choice of the in-plane crystallographic axis along which the superconducting phase bias is applied offer additional tunable knobs to test Majorana bound states in these systems. Finally, we discuss signatures of Majorana bound states that could be probed experimentally by tunneling conductance measurements at the edge of the junction.},

Experimental evidence for MMs is so far based on the detection of several key signatures: for example, a conductance peak pinned to the Fermi energy or an oscillatory peak splitting in short 1D systems when the MMs overlap. However, most of these key signatures were probed only on one of the ends of the 1D system, and firm evidence for an MM requires the simultaneous detection of all the key signatures on both ends. Here we construct short atomic spin chains on a superconductor—also known as Shiba chains—up to a chain length of 45\,atoms using tip-assisted atom manipulation in scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments. We observe zero-energy conductance peaks localized at both ends of the chain that simultaneously split off from the Fermi energy in an oscillatory fashion after altering the chain length. By fitting the parameters of a low-energy model to the data, we find that the peaks are consistent with precursors of MMs that evolve into isolated MMs protected by an estimated topological gap of 50\,μeV in chains of at least 35\,nm length, corresponding to 70\,atoms.},

Numerous proposals build on this addition of electron pairing to originally non-superconducting systems and predict intriguing phases of matter, including topological3–7, odd-frequency8, nodal-point9 or Fulde–Ferrell–Larkin–Ovchinnikov10 superconductivity. Here we investigate the most miniature example of the proximity effect on only a single spin-degenerate quantum level of a surface state confined in a quantum corral11 on a superconducting substrate, built atom by atom by a scanning tunnelling microscope. Whenever an eigenmode of the corral is pitched close to the Fermi energy by adjusting the size of the corral, a pair of particle–hole symmetric states enters the gap of the superconductor. We identify these as spin-degenerate Andreev bound states theoretically predicted 50\,years ago by Machida and Shibata12, which had—so far—eluded detection by tunnel spectroscopy but were recently shown to be relevant for transmon qubit devices13,14. We further find that the observed anticrossings of the in-gap states are a measure of proximity-induced pairing in the eigenmodes of the quantum corral. Our results have direct consequences on the interpretation of impurity-induced in-gap states in superconductors, corroborate concepts to induce superconductivity into surface states and further pave the way towards superconducting artificial lattices.},

For systems in which the length of the system is very large (quasi-1D) we calculate analytically the exact topological invariant, and we find a rich corresponding phase diagram which is strongly dependent on the width of the system. We compare our results with previous results based on a few-band approximation. We also investigate numerically open two-dimensional systems of finite length in both directions. We use the recently introduced generalized Majorana polarization, which can locally evaluate the Majorana character of a given state. We find that the formation of Majoranas depends strongly on the geometry of the system: for a very elongated wire the finite-size numerical phase diagram reproduces the analytical phase diagram for infinite systems, while if the length and the width are comparable, no Majorana states can form; however, one can show the formation of “quasi-Majorana” states that have a local Majorana character but no global Majorana symmetry.},

  abstract = {We investigate correlation effects in two-dimensional topological insulators (TI). In the first part, we discuss finite size effects for interacting systems of different sizes in a ribbon geometry. For large systems, there are two pairs of well separated massless modes on both edges. For these systems, we analyze the finite size effects using a standard bosonization approach. For small systems, where the edge states are massive Dirac fermions, we use the inhomogeneous dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) combined with iterative perturbation theory as an impurity solver to study interaction effects. We show that the finite size gap in the edge states is renormalized for weak interactions, which is consistent with a Fermi-liquid picture for small size TIs. In the second part, we investigate phase transitions in finite size TIs at zero temperature focusing on the effects of possible interedge umklapp scattering for the edge states within the inhomogeneous DMFT using the numerical renormalization group. We show that correlation effects are effectively stronger near the edge sites because the coordination number is smaller than in the bulk. Therefore the localization of the edge states around the edge sites, which is a fundamental property in TIs, is weakened for strong coupling strengths. However, we find no signs for “edge Mott insulating states” and the system stays in the topological insulating state, which is adiabatically connected to the noninteracting state for all interaction strengths smaller than the critical value. Increasing the interaction further, a nearly homogeneous Mott insulating state is stabilized.},

We then examine how edge modes can be generated if the Kitaev coupling on the bonds perpendicular to the edge is varied periodically in time as periodic δ-function kicks. We derive a general condition for the appearance and disappearance of the Floquet edge modes as a function of the drive frequency for a generic d-dimensional integrable system. We confirm this general condition for the Kitaev model with a finite width by mapping it to a one-dimensional model. Our numerical and analytical study of this problem shows that Floquet Majorana modes can appear on some edges in the kicked system even when the corresponding equilibrium Hamiltonian has no Majorana mode solutions on those edges. We support our analytical studies by numerics for a finite sized system which show that periodic kicks can generate modes at the edges and the corners of the lattice.},

It is the aim of this paper to review and analyze experimental observations with respect to the magnetotransport in Bi-based 3D topological insulators, as well as the superconducting transport properties of hybrid structures consisting of superconductors and these topological insulators. The helical spin-momentum coupling of the surface state electrons becomes visible in quantum corrections to the conductivity and magnetoresistance oscil-lations. An analysis will be provided of the reported magnetoresistance, also in the presence of bulk conductivity shunts. Special attention is given to the large and linear magnetoresistance. Superconductivity can be induced in topological superconductors by means of the proximity effect. The induced supercurrents, Josephson effects and current–phase relations will be reviewed.

The evolution of the peak under varying magnetic field, temperature, and tunneling barrier is consistent with the tunneling to a nearly pure MBS, separated from nontopological bound states.

In this geometry, there is no need for the proximity gap to overcome the bulk insulating gap of the QAHI to create MZMs as in the two-dimensional QAHI/superconductor (QAHI/SC) heterostructures. Therefore, the topological regime with MZMs is greatly enlarged. Furthermore, due to the presence of a single helical channel, the generation of low energy in-gap bound states caused by multiple conducting channels is avoided such that the MZMs can be well separated from other in-gap excitations in energy. This simple but practical approach allows the creation of a large number of MZMs in devices with complicated geometry such as hexons for measurement-based topological quantum computation. We further demonstrate how braiding of MZMs can be performed by controlling the coupling strength between the counter-propagating electron modes.},

  abstract = {In monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), electrons in opposite K valleys are subject to opposite effective Zeeman fields, which are referred to as Ising spin-orbit coupling (SOC) fields. The Ising SOC, originating from in-plane mirror symmetry breaking, pins the electron spins to the out-of-plane directions, and results in Ising superconducting states with strongly enhanced upper critical fields. Here, we show that the Ising SOC generates equal-spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin polarized in the in-plane directions. Importantly, the spin-triplet Cooper pairs can induce superconducting pairings in a half-metal wire placed on top of the TMD and result in a topological superconductor with Majorana end states. Direct ways to detect equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs and the differences between Ising superconductors and Rashba superconductors are discussed.},

  abstract = {Topological superconductivity supports exotic Majorana bound states (MBS) which are chargeless zero-energy emergent quasiparticles. With their non-Abelian exchange statistics and fractionalization of a single electron stored nonlocally as a spatially separated MBS, they are particularly suitable for implementing fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. While realizing MBS has focused on one-dimensional systems, the onset of topological superconductivity requires delicate parameter tuning and geometric constraints pose significant challenges for their control and demonstration of non-Abelian statistics. To overcome these challenges, building on recent experiments in planar Josephson junctions (JJs), we propose a MBS platform of X-shaped JJs. This versatile implementation reveals how external flux control of the superconducting phase difference can generate and manipulate multiple MBS pairs to probe non-Abelian statistics. The underlying topological superconductivity exists over a large parameter space, consistent with materials used in our fabrication of such X junctions, as an important step towards scalable topological quantum computing.},
