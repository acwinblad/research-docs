Hello, thank you for the introduction.

/// Outline

Let's get started.
This talk is outlined as follows.
I'll talk about Majorana fermions in particle physics, condensed matter, and how it relates to quantum computing.
Next the motivation for triangular islands is based off of p-wave superconductor T-junctions
I talk about the motivation behind the research, p-wave superconductors, T-junction wires, and triangular structures.
Followed by some formulation, which includes some of my previous work then why decide to include a Peierls substitution into Kitaev's model.
The results will be next where I talk about topological phase of our system, show Majorana zero-modes on a triangular chain and a hollow triangle.
Finally I wrap it all up and talk briefly about next steps.
